# ChainCraft — Quantum Edition (Pitch Summary)

**Tagline:** Quantum-safe NFT social hub — mint, trade, and message with wallet-linked identities on Cellframe.

**Problem:** Creators lack a unified, secure, and mobile-first social marketplace that protects long-term cryptographic security.

**Solution:** ChainCraft Quantum Edition:
- Wallet-linked usernames & profiles
- NFT minting & gallery
- Wallet-to-wallet encrypted messaging (XMTP scaffold)
- Tokenized tipping & gamified collection progress
- Mock Cellframe SDK integration for quantum-safe keys

**Why Cellframe:** ChainCraft becomes the social NFT layer that leverages Cellframe's post-quantum cryptography and network to anchor identity, provide quantum-resistant signing, and scale marketplaces.

**Demo Flow (2 min):**
1. Connect wallet (MetaMask or mock).
2. Create username & profile.
3. Mint first NFT (mock on backend).
4. Send an encrypted message to another wallet.
5. Tip a friend (mock ERC-20).
6. Show leaderboard & activity feed.

**Ask:** Winner's grant to deploy Cellframe-integrated NFT chains + mentorship to migrate mock adapters to real Cellframe SDK.
